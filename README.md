# Learn Vuex

> A Vue.js project

This repo contains some simplest case examples on Vuex for learning purpose. I also add my daily logs here, about what I have learned so far to keep track of my progress.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
